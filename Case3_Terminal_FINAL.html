RIVERSIDE APARTMENTS, BUILDING 3
INCIDENT DATE: OCTOBER 12, 2024, 23:00 HOURS

CASE SUMMARY:

At approximately 23:00 hours, three gunshots were fired inside Riverside Apartments, Building 3. Multiple residents called 911 reporting gunfire.

Police response located three spent shell casings in Apartment 3B (first floor, center unit). Suspect was apprehended fleeing the building. A 9mm handgun was recovered.

No injuries reported. Ballistic analysis confirmed all three shots were fired from the recovered weapon inside Apartment 3B.

WITNESS TESTIMONY DISCREPANCIES:

Two key witnesses provided conflicting accounts of the incident:

Witness 1 - Resident of Apartment 3A (first floor, directly adjacent to 3B):
Claims: "I heard THREE gunshots. They came from ABOVE me - directly overhead. The sound was HIGH-PITCHED, like a small caliber weapon."

Witness 2 - Resident of Apartment 4B (second floor, directly above 3B):
Claims: "I heard TWO gunshots. They came from BELOW me. The sound was DEEP and BOOMING, like a large caliber weapon."

VERIFIED FACTS:

- Physical evidence: THREE shots fired (three shell casings recovered)
- Location: Apartment 3B (first floor)
- Weapon: 9mm pistol (medium frequency sound signature)
- Building layout: Standard hallway configuration with hard surfaces

DISPUTE:

Both witnesses are confident in their accounts. Both are wrong about either the number of shots, the location of shots, or the sound characteristics - or all three.

YOUR ROLE:

You have been retained as an independent forensic psychology consultant to analyze how acoustic properties of the building and limitations of human auditory localization could explain these discrepancies.

Your expertise in auditory perception and sound localization is required.

WITNESS 1: Jennifer Martinez
AGE: 42
RESIDENCE: Apartment 3A, Riverside Apartments Building 3
INTERVIEWED BY: Detective James Wilson
DATE/TIME: October 12, 2024, 23:35 hours

STATEMENT (Verbatim Transcript):

"I was in my living room watching TV when I heard the gunshots. It was around 11 PM. I know it was gunshots immediately - I grew up in a rough neighborhood, so I know that sound.

I heard THREE distinct shots. They were spaced maybe 2 or 3 seconds apart. Bang... bang... bang. Three shots, I'm certain.

The shots came from ABOVE me. I'm positive about that. The sound came from directly overhead, like from the second floor apartment above mine. I live on the first floor, so the sound had to be coming from upstairs.

The sound was sharp and high-pitched - like a small gun, maybe a .22 or something like that. Not a big heavy gun. It had that sharp, crackling sound to it.

I immediately got on the floor and called 911. I told them shots were fired in the apartment above me.

I know what I heard. Three shots, from above, high-pitched sound."

DETECTIVE'S NOTES:
- Witness appeared calm and credible
- No hearing impairment noted
- Apartment 3A is on first floor, directly adjacent to 3B (shares a wall)
- Witness has no criminal record
- Appeared confident in account

WITNESS 2: David Park
AGE: 38
RESIDENCE: Apartment 4B, Riverside Apartments Building 3
INTERVIEWED BY: Detective James Wilson  
DATE/TIME: October 12, 2024, 23:42 hours

STATEMENT (Verbatim Transcript):

"I was in my bedroom getting ready for bed when I heard gunshots. This was about 11 PM.

I heard TWO shots. They were loud - really loud. There was a pause of a few seconds between them. Two definite shots.

The shots came from BELOW me. I live on the second floor, and the sound was clearly coming from the first floor, directly beneath my apartment.

The sound was deep and booming - like a heavy caliber weapon, maybe a .45 or even bigger. It had that deep, bass-heavy sound that shakes your chest. Definitely a big gun.

I immediately moved away from the floor and called 911. I told them there was shooting in the apartment below mine.

I'm absolutely certain about what I heard. Two shots, from below, deep sound."

DETECTIVE'S NOTES:
- Witness appeared shaken but coherent
- No hearing impairment noted
- Apartment 4B is on second floor, directly above 3B (3B is below)
- Witness is a military veteran with firearms experience
- Very confident in assessment
- Seemed puzzled when informed shots came from adjacent unit, not below

FORENSIC AUDIO SERVICES
CASE NUMBER: 2024-10-12-2300

FACILITY: Riverside Apartments, Building 3
DATE OF ANALYSIS: October 13, 2024
ANALYST: Acoustic Engineer Dr. Lisa Thompson, Ph.D.

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS:

Riverside Apartments, Building 3 is a standard two-story residential structure built in 2015.

Construction materials:
- Walls: Drywall on wood studs (standard residential construction)
- Floors/Ceilings: Wood joist construction with carpet on second floor, tile on first floor
- Hallways: Tile floors, painted drywall walls, acoustical ceiling tiles
- Doors: Hollow-core wood doors

Sound Transmission Classification (STC):
- Interior walls: STC 33 (minimal sound isolation)
- Floor/ceiling assemblies: STC 50 (moderate sound isolation)
- Corridor walls: STC 40 (moderate sound isolation)

HALLWAY ACOUSTIC PROPERTIES:

The hallway configuration is critical to sound propagation in this building:

Dimensions: 6 feet wide × 8 feet high × 80 feet long
Surface materials:
- Floor: Ceramic tile (highly reflective to sound)
- Walls: Painted drywall (moderately reflective)
- Ceiling: Drop acoustical tiles (partially absorptive, but still reflective at high frequencies)

Reverberation time: 1.2 seconds (longer than typical living spaces)
Echo pattern: Multiple discrete echoes due to parallel hard surfaces

SOUND PROPAGATION ANALYSIS:

When a gunshot is fired in Apartment 3B:

Path 1: Through shared wall to Apartment 3A
- Direct transmission through wall (minimal delay)
- Some high-frequency attenuation due to wall mass

Path 2: Through door into hallway
- Sound enters hallway (minimal attenuation)
- Reflects off hard hallway surfaces (tile floor, walls, ceiling)
- Multiple reflections create complex echo pattern
- Sound propagates both directions down hallway

Path 3: Through floor to Apartment 4B above
- Transmission through floor/ceiling assembly
- Some low-frequency emphasis due to structural vibration
- High frequencies attenuated more than low frequencies

MEASURED SOUND CHARACTERISTICS:

A controlled test was conducted using a calibrated sound source (500-1000 Hz frequency range, similar to 9mm gunshot) placed in Apartment 3B.

Sound recordings made simultaneously in Apartments 3A and 4B:

APARTMENT 3A (adjacent, first floor):
- Primary sound arrival: Direct through shared wall (0 ms)
- Secondary arrivals: Reflected from hallway (15-45 ms delays)
- Frequency emphasis: High frequencies present, some hallway echoes boost mid-range
- Perceived direction: Ambiguous (combination of direct and reflected sound)

APARTMENT 4B (above, second floor):
- Primary sound arrival: Through floor (5 ms)
- Secondary arrivals: Reflected from hallway (20-50 ms delays)
- Frequency emphasis: Low frequencies emphasized due to floor transmission, high frequencies attenuated
- Perceived direction: Ambiguous (combination of floor transmission and hallway reflections)

ECHO PATTERN ANALYSIS:

The hallway creates a complex pattern of echoes:

Initial sound (0 ms) → 1st echo from opposite wall (18 ms) → 2nd echo from end of hallway (62 ms) → 3rd echo from ceiling (35 ms) → 4th echo (combinations, 80-120 ms)

These echoes can:
- Make single sounds appear as multiple sounds
- Obscure the true number of sounds
- Create ambiguous directional cues
- Alter perceived frequency content

FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS:

High frequencies (>2000 Hz):
- Attenuated by walls and floors
- Reflected strongly by hallway hard surfaces
- Create sharp, "crackling" sound quality

Low frequencies (<500 Hz):
- Transmit more easily through walls and floors
- Create structural vibrations
- Perceived as "booming" or "deep" sound

Mid frequencies (500-1000 Hz):
- Most characteristic of 9mm gunshot
- Mixed transmission and reflection pattern

CONCLUSIONS (Factual Observations Only):

1. Sound from Apartment 3B reaches both 3A and 4B through multiple paths
2. Hallway reflections create complex echo patterns
3. Echoes can make single sounds appear as multiple sounds, or multiple sounds appear as fewer
4. Frequency content is altered differently for different listeners based on transmission path
5. Directional cues are ambiguous due to multiple arrival paths

This analysis presents measured acoustic data. Interpretation of how these factors affect human sound localization should be conducted by auditory perception experts.

            docc: `DOCUMENT C: AUDITORY LOCALIZATION PRINCIPLES
PREPARED FOR LEGAL CONSULTATION
SOURCE: National Institute of Hearing Research

This document provides general scientific information about human sound localization capabilities. These are established principles in auditory science and do not constitute opinion about any specific case.

SECTION 1: BINAURAL CUES FOR SOUND LOCALIZATION

Humans localize sound in space primarily using binaural cues - differences between the sound arriving at the two ears.

INTERAURAL TIME DIFFERENCE (ITD):

When a sound originates from one side, it reaches the near ear slightly before the far ear.

Mechanism:
- Sound from right side reaches right ear first, left ear later
- Time difference ranges from 0 microseconds (front/back) to ~700 microseconds (90° to side)
- Brain detects this time difference with microsecond precision
- Used primarily for localizing low-frequency sounds (<1500 Hz)

Effectiveness:
- Excellent for horizontal (left-right) localization
- Poor for vertical (up-down) localization
- Poor for front-back discrimination

INTERAURAL LEVEL DIFFERENCE (ILD):

When a sound originates from one side, the head creates an "acoustic shadow," making the sound slightly louder at the near ear.

Mechanism:
- Head blocks high-frequency sounds more effectively than low frequencies
- Creates intensity/volume difference between ears
- Difference ranges from 0 dB (front/back) to ~20 dB at high frequencies (90° to side)
- Used primarily for high-frequency sounds (>1500 Hz)

Effectiveness:
- Excellent for horizontal (left-right) localization
- Poor for vertical (up-down) localization
- Poor for front-back discrimination

SECTION 2: LIMITATIONS OF BINAURAL CUES

VERTICAL LOCALIZATION:

Determining whether a sound is above, below, or at ear level is much more difficult than horizontal localization because:

- ITD and ILD provide minimal information about elevation
- Sounds above and at ear level can have nearly identical binaural cues
- Brain must rely on other cues (see spectral cues below)

Accuracy:
- Horizontal localization: ±5-10 degrees typical accuracy
- Vertical localization: ±20-40 degrees typical accuracy (much worse)

FRONT-BACK CONFUSION:

Sounds directly in front and directly behind have identical ITD and ILD values, creating ambiguity.

Resolution:
- Head movements (change position to disambiguate)
- Spectral cues from pinna filtering
- Visual information
- Context and expectation

In stationary listening without visual cues: 20-30% front-back confusion rate is normal.

SECTION 3: SPECTRAL CUES AND PINNA FILTERING

The outer ear (pinna) has a complex shape that filters sound frequencies differently depending on source elevation.

Mechanism:
- Sound from above emphasizes certain frequencies
- Sound from below emphasizes different frequencies
- Brain learns these patterns through experience
- Acts as a frequency-dependent filter

Effectiveness:
- Moderately helpful for vertical localization
- Requires learning (not innate)
- Easily disrupted by unfamiliar sounds or acoustic environments
- Works best in anechoic (echo-free) environments

SECTION 4: REVERBERATION AND ECHOES

In enclosed spaces with hard surfaces, sound reflects off walls, floors, and ceilings, creating echoes.

EFFECT ON LOCALIZATION:

Multiple sound arrivals:
- Direct sound arrives first
- Reflections arrive later (delays of 10-100+ milliseconds)
- Brain receives conflicting directional cues
- Localization accuracy degrades significantly

Precedence Effect (Haas Effect):
- Brain typically assigns localization based on FIRST arrival
- Later arrivals (echoes) are partially suppressed for localization
- However, echoes still influence perceived sound quality and can create confusion

In highly reverberant spaces:
- Horizontal localization accuracy reduced by 50-80%
- Vertical localization becomes nearly impossible
- Front-back confusions increase dramatically

SECTION 5: FREQUENCY CONTENT AND PERCEPTION

Different frequencies are perceived differently:

HIGH FREQUENCIES (>2000 Hz):
- Perceived as sharp, bright, "crackling"
- Provide good directional information (via ILD)
- Easily blocked by barriers
- Reflected strongly by hard surfaces

LOW FREQUENCIES (<500 Hz):
- Perceived as deep, booming, bass-heavy
- Provide directional information via ITD
- Penetrate barriers more easily
- Less reflection, more transmission through structures

MIDDLE FREQUENCIES (500-2000 Hz):
- Balanced perception
- Both ITD and ILD contribute to localization
- Mixed transmission/reflection properties

FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT TRANSMISSION:

When sound passes through walls, floors, or other barriers:
- High frequencies are attenuated (blocked) more than low frequencies
- Result: Sound becomes more bass-heavy after transmission
- A gunshot (broad frequency range) may sound "deeper" through a wall than in open air

SECTION 6: COUNTING DISCRETE SOUNDS

Humans typically distinguish discrete sounds if they are separated by >50-100 milliseconds.

ECHO INTERFERENCE:

When echoes arrive 10-50 ms after original sound:
- May be perceived as single prolonged sound
- May be perceived as additional discrete sounds
- Listener cannot reliably count separate events

In reverberant hallways:
- Single gunshot creates multiple echoes
- May be perceived as 2-3 sounds
- Three gunshots with echoes may be perceived as 2, 3, 4, or 5+ sounds
- Count accuracy is unreliable

SECTION 7: INDIVIDUAL AND SITUATIONAL FACTORS

Sound localization accuracy varies based on:

Listener factors:
- Hearing acuity (hearing loss reduces localization ability)
- Experience with sounds
- Attention and arousal (stress impairs localization)
- Head position and movement

Environmental factors:
- Reverberation and echo patterns
- Background noise
- Acoustic properties of space
- Number and proximity of reflective surfaces

Sound characteristics:
- Frequency content
- Duration
- Intensity
- Familiarity

SECTION 8: CONFIDENCE VS. ACCURACY

Research consistently shows:
- Listener confidence in localization judgments does NOT correlate well with accuracy
- People are often highly confident in incorrect localization judgments
- In ambiguous acoustic environments, confidence can remain high even when accuracy is poor

This is particularly true for:
- Vertical localization
- Reverberant environments
- Unfamiliar sounds
- High-stress situations

This document presents established principles of auditory perception. Application to specific cases requires analysis of all relevant factors by qualified experts.

JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 145(2), 2024
TITLE: "Sound Source Localization Accuracy in Residential Hallways"

ABSTRACT:

We investigated human ability to localize gunshot sounds in a residential building environment similar to typical apartment complexes. Participants (n=40) attempted to identify the location of recorded gunshot sounds played from various locations within an apartment building.

METHODOLOGY:

Facility:
- Three-story apartment building scheduled for demolition
- Standard hallway construction (tile floors, drywall walls)
- Multiple apartments per floor

Sound Source:
- Recorded 9mm gunshot (authentic recording from ballistic testing)
- Frequency range: 100-8000 Hz (typical gunshot spectrum)
- Peak intensity: 160 dB at source (reduced to safe levels for participants)

Participants:
- 40 adults (ages 25-60)
- Normal hearing (confirmed by audiometric testing)
- 15 participants had military or law enforcement firearms experience
- 25 participants had no firearms experience

Procedure:
Sound played from various apartments. Participants in different apartments asked to identify:
1. Horizontal location (which apartment?)
2. Vertical location (which floor?)
3. Number of shots fired
4. Perceived frequency/pitch

EXPERIMENT 1: HORIZONTAL LOCALIZATION

Sound source: Apartment 2B (center unit, second floor)
Listeners: Distributed in Apartments 2A (adjacent), 2C (adjacent), 3B (above), 1B (below)

RESULTS:

Correct identification of horizontal location (which apartment):
- Overall accuracy: 35% (14 out of 40 participants)
- Firearms-experienced participants: 40% accuracy
- No-experience participants: 32% accuracy
- Not significantly different (p > 0.05)

Common errors:
- 28% identified source as adjacent apartment
- 22% identified source as "somewhere in hallway"
- 15% could not determine location

Confidence ratings:
- Mean confidence: 6.8/10
- No correlation between confidence and accuracy (r = 0.12)
- Some highly confident participants were incorrect

EXPERIMENT 2: VERTICAL LOCALIZATION

Sound source: Apartment 2B (second floor, center)
Listeners: Apartments on floors 1, 2, and 3

RESULTS:

Vertical localization errors:
- 67% of participants made errors in vertical localization
- 42% thought sound was from different floor than actual
- 25% reported "difficult to tell" which floor

Specific error patterns:
Listeners on Floor 1 (below source):
- 52% incorrectly thought sound came from above them (when source was actually above)
- 31% correctly identified as above
- 17% thought sound came from same floor

Listeners on Floor 2 (same level as source):
- 41% incorrectly thought sound came from above or below (when source was same floor)
- 59% correctly identified as same floor

Listeners on Floor 3 (above source):
- 58% incorrectly thought sound came from below them (when source was actually below)
- 27% correctly identified as below
- 15% thought sound came from same floor

INTERPRETATION: Vertical localization was highly unreliable in hallway environment.

EXPERIMENT 3: COUNTING SOUNDS

Three gunshots fired with 2-second intervals between shots.
Participants asked: "How many shots did you hear?"

RESULTS:

Correct count (3 shots): 48%
Incorrect counts:
- 2 shots: 23%
- 4 shots: 17%
- 5 or more shots: 9%
- Could not determine: 3%

Analysis:
Errors correlated with:
- Distance from source (more errors at greater distance)
- Location in hallway (more errors near hallway ends where echoes converge)
- No correlation with firearms experience

INTERPRETATION: Echoes and reverber ations made accurate counting difficult for approximately half of participants.

EXPERIMENT 4: FREQUENCY/PITCH PERCEPTION

Same 9mm gunshot recording (objective frequency: 500-1000 Hz primary energy) played from Apartment 2B.

Participants asked to characterize sound as:
- High-pitched (small caliber weapon)
- Medium-pitched (medium caliber)
- Low-pitched/booming (large caliber)

RESULTS:

Overall distribution:
- 40% reported "high-pitched"
- 35% reported "medium-pitched"
- 25% reported "low-pitched/booming"

Same sound, different perceptions!

Analysis by listener location:

Listeners in ADJACENT apartments (sound through wall):
- 62% reported "high-pitched"
- Reason: High frequencies transmitted through direct wall path

Listeners ABOVE or BELOW source (sound through floor):
- 58% reported "low-pitched/booming"
- Reason: Floor transmission emphasizes low frequencies

Listeners in HALLWAY:
- 47% reported "medium-pitched"
- Reason: Mixture of direct and reflected sound

EXPERIMENT 5: EFFECT OF EXPECTATION

Participants divided into two groups for same test:

Group A: Told "Report what you hear"
Group B: Told "Shots may come from above, below, or same level - report which"

RESULTS:

Vertical localization accuracy:
- Group A: 33% correct
- Group B: 31% correct
- No significant difference

However, confidence was affected:
- Group A: Mean confidence 5.2/10
- Group B: Mean confidence 7.1/10

INTERPRETATION: Priming participants to think about vertical location increased confidence but did not improve accuracy.

DISCUSSION:

The researchers conclude:

"Sound localization in residential hallways with hard surfaces is fundamentally unreliable due to:

1. Complex echo patterns that obscure true source location
2. Frequency-dependent transmission through walls and floors creating different perceptions for different listeners
3. Poor vertical localization even under optimal conditions
4. Echo-based confusion about number of discrete sounds

Critically, listener confidence does not predict accuracy. Participants reported high confidence even when completely wrong about location, floor level, or number of shots.

Firearms experience provided minimal advantage, suggesting these errors are driven by acoustic environment rather than listener expertise.

In legal contexts, eyewitness (or ear-witness) testimony about sound location in buildings should be considered highly unreliable without corroborating physical evidence."

LIMITATIONS:

- Controlled environment (empty building)
- No background noise
- Participants knew they were in experiment
- Single sound source type

CONCLUSIONS:

Human sound localization in residential hallways with hard surfaces shows:
- Poor horizontal accuracy (35%)
- Very poor vertical accuracy (33%)
- Unreliable counting (52% error rate for 3 shots)
- Highly variable frequency perception of identical sound

These limitations appear fundamental to acoustic environment, not listener capability.
